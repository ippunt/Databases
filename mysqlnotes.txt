CREATE DATABASE - CREATE USER - GRANT PRIVLEGES 
mysql -u root -padmin16
create database PRIEMEREJD;
create user 'darling'@'%' identified by 'actualpasswd'; #user can get on the system from anywhere, and from localhost
create user 'darling'@'localhost' identified by 'actualpasswd' ; # user that can sign on from localhost only     
if you ssh in you are considered localhost

grant all on PRIEMEREJD.* to 'darling'@'%' identified by 'actualpasswd'; # grants all premissions to darling on DB from anywhere, can not drop yourself (use root)
grant all on PREMIEREJD.* to 'darling'@'localhost' identified by 'actualpasswd'; # grants all permission from localhost

http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/grant.html#grant-privileges    # info on grants specific

from mysql prompt use PREMIEREJD; # to use empty database

source filename  # the file must be in the directory you were currently in when you opened mysql
# it will build your DB from a file that has been dumped
drop user darling@localhost; # be able to undo everything
drop user darling;							<^# they are seen as different so must delete each individually
drop database PREMIEREJD;

DUMP DATABASE TO A FILE
mysqldump -u root -pactualpasswd DBNAME > MYDB1.mysql  # I know this works but have also saw it written like this
mysqldump -u root -pactualpasswd -d DBNAME > MYDB1.mysql # They both work

REMOTE CONNECTIVITY
https://easyengine.io/tutorials/mysql/remote-access/     #helped me alot
To access the mysql server you will need grant privledges from anywhere %
but mysql only allows localhost in fil.conf so comment it out or add ip address
/etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf    
comment out this line   bind-address           = 127.0.0.1   not very secure then anyone can get to it
ensure iptables has proper config for connectivity , or use ufw or firewalld what ever preferred

DATABASE CREATION NOTES
-Good syntax for database creation
 create table Items (Name varchar(255) not null, Description varchar(255), price decimal(4,2), primary key (Name));
- create table Customers (CustomerNum int auto_increment, Name varchar(255), Number varchar(255), E_mail varchar(255),
 primary key (CustomerNum));

-Primary and foreign Good idea to use individual lines for debugging code its not all on the same line
sql can better tell you exactly whats wrong on what line instead of everything being on one line 
create table Orders                                                          
    -> (OrderNum int not null auto_increment,
    -> OrderDate Date,
    -> CustomerNum int,
    -> primary key (OrderNum),
    -> foreign key (CustomerNum) references Customers(CustomerNum));
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.38 sec)


-Just for referenceing syntax
create table Transaction
 (OrderNum int not null,
 Name varchar(255) not null,
 NumOrdered decimal(2),
 QuotedPrice decimal(4,2),
 TransNum int not null auto_increment,
 primary key (TransNum),
 foreign key (OrderNum) references Orders(OrderNum),
 foreign key (Name) references Items(Name));
