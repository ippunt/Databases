VERY BASICS
sqlite3 MyDBName # as simple as that to create a database
.help  # will help you with getting started
create table TBName ("id" integer primary key autoincrement, friends char(25)); # friends list auto counter, I have too many
to count :)
____________________________________________________
BACKUP MY DATABASE
echo .dump | sqlite3 MyDBName.sqlite > MYDBNameBackup.sqlite

sqlite3 MYDBName2.sqlite < MYDBNameBackup.sqlite # inserting the dump file into database now DB2 has all the data from DB1
# With automating this with scripting you could get alot done, really quick!
